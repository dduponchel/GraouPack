This is an highly experimental (read : doesn't work) test of a pure javascript UI for creating an IzPack xml.
The goal of this application : provide an easy way to create an IzPack xml, and preview what your installer would look like.
No heavy app to install, just a browser.
The only browser tested is Firefox 3.6. It should works fine on firefox 3.x, and there is a risk it would work on opera/safari/chrome.
