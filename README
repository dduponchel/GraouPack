This is an highly experimental (read : doesn't work) test of a pure 
javascript UI for creating an IzPack xml.
The goal of this application : provide an easy way to create an IzPack xml,
and preview what your installer would look like.
No heavy app to install, just a browser.
The only browser tested is Firefox 3.6. It should works fine on firefox 3.x,
and there is a risk it would work on opera/safari/chrome.

Known limitations : since it runs in a browser, it will only be able to 
generate the xml. It's up to you to copy/paste it in a file, and run 
IzPack's bin/compile on it.

GraouPack is published under the terms of the new BSD License.
Some third-party components (e.g., jQuery and its plugins) may be released
under different terms.
