=== IMPORTANT ===
The branch master is deprecated ! I'm working on a "refactoring" (same type as for IzPack) with jmvc 3 (branch develop) and it's still quite a mess. As soon as the branch develop is stable and have enough features, I will merge them :)
=== /IMPORTANT ===


This is an highly experimental (read : don't work) test of a pure 
javascript UI for creating an IzPack xml.
The goal of this application : provide an easy way to create an IzPack xml,
and preview what your installer would look like.
No heavy app to install, just a browser.
The only browser tested is Firefox 3.6. It should works fine on firefox 3.x,
and there is a risk it would work on opera/safari/chrome.

Known limitations : 
 - This app should generate a valid xml for IzPack 5, but won't reflect all the
possibilities given by IzPack.
 - The app runs in your browser and can't launch the compilation of your installer.
You have to do it manually !
 - There are two ways for getting the generated zip : using the data url scheme
(works more or less, but isn't user-friendly) or a flash 10 component. On 
file://....index.html, this flash component will be displayed but won't work
(thanks Adobe for providing accessible, open, bullet-proof apps...).
A simple static http server will do the trick : apache http, nginx, lighthttpd,
or even simpler : cd GraouPack ; python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

Use offline : 
GraouPack uses external CDNs if possible for its dependencies (jQuery, etc).
If you want to use it offline, you have to download these projects and update
the file index.html. Be warned, some external files include others ! (for example
the css for jQuery UI. You should be fine with the whole project).

Tests : 
 - the tests can be run with js/test/index.html
 - cross browser code coverage is possible with jscoverage ( http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/ ) :
cd GraouPack ; jscoverage-server --verbose --no-instrument=/js/test/ --no-instrument=/js/lib/
then opens http://127.0.0.1:8080/jscoverage.html?js/test/index.html

The main repository is on GitHub ( http://github.com/dduponchel/GraouPack )
and this app can be seen deployed on google app engine ( http://graoupack.appspot.com/ )
thanks to DryDrop ( http://drydrop.binaryage.com/ ).
