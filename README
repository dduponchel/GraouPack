This is an highly experimental (read : doesn't work) test of a pure 
javascript UI for creating an IzPack xml.
The goal of this application : provide an easy way to create an IzPack xml,
and preview what your installer would look like.
No heavy app to install, just a browser.
The only browser tested is Firefox 3.6. It should works fine on firefox 3.x,
and there is a risk it would work on opera/safari/chrome.

Known limitations : since it runs in a browser, it will only be able to 
generate the xml. It's up to you to copy/paste it in a file, and run 
IzPack's bin/compile on it.

The main repository is on GitHub (http://github.com/dduponchel/GraouPack)
and this app can be seen deployed on google app engine (http://graoupack.appspot.com/)
thanks to DryDrop (http://drydrop.binaryage.com/).
